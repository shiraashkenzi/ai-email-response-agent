# Archive

This folder contains files that are not part of the core CLI submission.

## Contents

- **get_tokens.py** – Optional standalone script to generate Gmail OAuth tokens. The main application (`python main.py`) performs OAuth automatically on first run, so this script is only needed if you want to generate tokens separately.

## Removed for Submission

The following were removed to keep the repository clean and production-ready:

- **memory/** – Legacy conversation memory and entity store from a previous version. Not used by the CLI workflow.
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** – Redundant with README.md.

No credentials or secrets are stored in the archive.
